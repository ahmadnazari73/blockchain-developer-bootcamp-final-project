**Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021:** Final Project Idea

In this document, I am going to explain my idea for the final project. I want to name it **B**lockchain **G**ame **D**evelopment **BGD**. in simple words, This is a platform that developers can use in their projects and through which they can sell the n-game items or reward players, and it's allows you to manage in-game items as blockchain assets

**I will explain the main Features that can do with BGD:**

- Define Contracts and Tokens in your game's assets as scriptable objects.
- Visually edit Contracts and Tokens with the **BGD** Manager window.
- Deploy new contracts and tokens from backend services.
- Read wallets and update token quantities owned by the user at run time.

This project has many details and aspects that need to think more about, but for this step, I have explain key actions and keep it simple as much as I can. In the future, I will complete and add more details as much as needed.
